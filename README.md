# Exercises for Programmers

### Area of a Rectangular Room

Create a program that calculates the area of a room. Prompt the user for the length and width of the room in feet. Then display the area in both square feet and square meters.

The formula for this conversion is 

_m^2 = f^2 * 0.09290304_

#####Constraints

* Keep the calculations separate from the output.
* Use a constant to hold the conversion factor.

#####Challenges

* Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as numeric values. Don't allow the user to proceed if the value is not numeric.
* Create a new version of the program that allows you to choose feet or meters for your inputs.
* Implement this program as a GUI program that automatically updates the values when any value changes.
